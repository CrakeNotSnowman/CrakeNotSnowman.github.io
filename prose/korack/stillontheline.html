            <p>Heneritta worked from her home in customer support for the regions leading supplier of calling pigeons: birds which, when functioning, would connect people from all over Juntur so they could speak to each other. And when Heneritta finally returned home, she realized the client whom she had been speaking with prior to the summoning was still on the line. </p>

            <p>
                "I'M SORRY I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO HEAR YOU YET, Iâ€™LL TRY GOING BACK TO THE OTHER ROOM" the old lady screeched into her calling pigeon. Jumping onto the line, Heneritta replied, "I'm sorry about that, how's this? My manager had to step in and remotely adjust your receiver."</p>
