            <p>Heneritta worked from her home in customer support for the regions leading supplier of calling pigeons: birds which, when functioning, would connect people from all over Juntur so they could speak to each other. And when Heneritta finally returned home, she realized the client whom she had been speaking with prior to the summoning was still on the line. </p>

            <p>
                "I'M SORRY I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO HEAR YOU YET, Iâ€™LL TRY GOING BACK TO THE OTHER ROOM" the old lady screeched into her calling pigeon. Jumping onto the line, Heneritta replied, "I'm sorry about that, how's this? My manager had to step in and remotely adjust your receiver."</p>

            <p>"Oh thank you! Anyway as I was saying, this pigeon never seems to call the correct person." Heneritta knew the problem of course, the old lady never dialed the correct person. There's nothing a calling pigeon can do if it's given the wrong pigeon number. But this lady was sure it was the pigeon's fault and wouldn't rest until Pigeoncom 'solved' it for her. It would require this phone call, during which Heneritta would declare the problem fixed, a week to pass, another phone call where the old lady's case number would be reopened, and after that, a replacement pigeon would be sent out in two to six months. Then the lady would repeat the process until whomever she kept trying to call felt sorry enough for her to buy her a calling pelican, the product which was marketed exclusively towards the elderly thanks to its size and ease of use. It's such a doofy product too, but you can't knock products that stop these kinds of help calls.</p>

            <p>"Have you tried turning it off and on again?" Heneritta recited.</p>

            <p>"Yes, I put the cloth over it, it fell asleep, and I took it off and it reawakened, and it still won't call my nephew."</p>

            <p>"Then you'll have to reset it."</p>

            <p>"How do I do that?"</p>

            <p>Heneritta recited her script from memory, "With every calling pigeon we send a reset mallet. You'll have to get that, then we'll hang up and you'll have to hit the pigeon over the head with it. You'll have to give it a good swing, hard enough that you should hear a splat and crunch when you hit the pigeon, that sound indicates you successfully hit the reset. Once the pigeon is reset, give it one to two minutes to go through startup, then your pigeon should return to its original factory state. This means that any numbers your pigeon has saved will be erased, so we at Pigeoncom recommend you write them down on a piece of paper before resetting your pigeon.
            </p>

            <p>"Now calling pigeons come with a default child protection setting to prevent children from accidentally resetting your pigeon without permission. Unless you ordered a lobotomized calling pigeon, you can assume your pigeon has this setting enabled. This means your pigeon will avoid the mallet at all costs, so you have to be quick and persistent at it. We recommend shutting all windows and doors during the reset process as a precaution to avoid any unwanted pigeon escape. As part of the child protection, the pigeon will also squawk a fair amount, in attempts to alert parental units of an unwanted reset attempt taking place. Feel free to ignore these squawks as you are purposefully resetting this pigeon. And don't worry if you miss at first, it happens. We at Pigeoncom believe in you!
            </p>

            <p>"Now I will call you back five minutes after you begin your reset process. This will ensure you speak with the same technician and to verify a successful reset. In the event you don't pick up, I will call you back every five minutes for up to one half hour thereafter. Do you understand your instructions?"
            </p>

            <p>"Yeah yeah I heard you," mumbled the old lady. "Give me a moment while I find this damn mallet." 
            </p>

            <p>"I will wait here while you find your reset mallet, please let me know when you have it ready."
            </p>

            <p><i>"This is the best part of any call."</i> thought Heneritta. <i>"I finally get peace and quiet while being paid to do nothing and not take calls while someone fumbles around and waits for the pigeon startup after the reset. Plus this old lady stayed on the line the whole time I was dragged away to that stupid council of the elder dragons meeting, so I get paid for that time."</i></p>

            <p>"Ok I've got this damn thing. You know it really it heavy, how do you expect older customers to use it?"</p>

            <p>"We can send out a technician if you're having trouble ma'am."</p>

            <p>"I did that once and they charged me through the nose. I'm not falling for that scam again. I just think they should be lighter"</p>

            <p>"I'll forward your suggestion along to <i>`My Manager'</i>" said Heneritta affirming to herself that "My Manager" was the perfect name for her trashcan. "Are you ready to begin the reset?"</p>

            <p>"Yes I have the damn mallet don't I?"</p>

            <p>"Then when you are ready please hang up and I will call you in five minutes. Thank you for calling Pigeoncom today!"</p>

            <p>Following protocol, Heneritta waited for the lady to hang up the phone, rather than hanging up herself, an offense she had committed once before and gotten written up for. Sitting back Heneritta started her five minute timer and leaned back to think about her day thus far. Just as she closed her eyes, she heard a loud squawk, the flapping of wings, a thud, more flapping, and the stream of swears the old lady let out. </p>

            <p>"Damn lady forgot to hang up" thought Heneritta. "And she missed."</p>
